    "## Programming and Abstraction\n",

    ">Once you realize that computing is all about constructing, manipulating, and reasoning about abstractions, it becomes clear that an important prerequisite for writing (good) computer programs is the ability to handle abstractions in a precise manner. (Keith Devlin)\n",
