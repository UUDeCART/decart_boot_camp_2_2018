    "Clinical reports are often divided into sections. Physicians are taught to write their reports in the SOAP format: subjective information, objective information, assessment, and plan, and sections often reflect this process. Information each setion may be formatted differently. For example, subjective information is often narrative, telling a story of the patient's description of their past medical history and their current issues. The objective section may be much more telegraphic with shortened descriptions of measurements like blood pressure and heart rate, such as \"120/80 88\". You may need different NLP techniques to accurately extract information out of different sections. Sentence splitting, for example, may be different in subjective versus objective sections. Radiology reports are not in the SOAP format, but section identification can still be very important, because in these reports the radiologist describes what she sees on the radiographic image then sometimes summarizes her impression of what the observations may represent, such as \"the infiltrate could be consistent with pneumonia.\" For some tasks, you may only be interested in the impression, which has more weight than the reasoning that occurs in the Findings section."
